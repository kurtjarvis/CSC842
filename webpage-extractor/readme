## Description
The webpage extractor is a tool that I am automating to see what webpage links are embedded on a page to include all the src scripts that are in there for inspection. My goal is to link this in to other automation opportunities to allow some pentesting to happen automatically.

## Installation
Basic install requires the following:
 python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
All set!

## Additional Resources
None needed. This is based on basic recon steps needed to understand the environment prior to diving off into threat vectors of a webpage.
