# ZigBee Packet Analyzer Readme

## Contributor

* Script Name: zibgeePacketAnalzyer.py
* Base: https://github.com/tadiaz/DSU created a tool called "tool-two.py" that I wanted to see if it could do the same tricks for zigbee data

## Description
This tool is a way to pull out metrics on zigbee traffic from a captured pcap and see what kind of activity is happening based on the traffic. This tool was started by "tadiaz" during cycle 4 and I tried converting it to support ZigBee and not just tcp/ip data. This creates an image that shows the distribution of communication types within the ZigBee protocol. This can be helpful to determine which devices are acting as a coordinator, a router, or an end-device. It also shows who is pulling the load wihtin the network.

## Installation
Basic install requires the following:
 python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
All set!
