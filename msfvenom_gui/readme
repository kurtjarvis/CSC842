## Description
The webpage extractor is a tool that provides a gui front-end to the msfvenom payload generator. Props to bluesentinelsec for creating the tool in ptinker using poetry. I took that idea and refactored it into a PyQt5 gui.

## Installation
Basic install requires the following:
 python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
All set!

## Additional Resources
I used PyQt5 for the development, so digging through the documentation is where I sat.
